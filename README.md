# vschn

`vschn` is a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you read HackerNews in your editor.
It does so by templating out the stories into various coding languages.

## Usage

- Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
- Type `vschn` and select `vschn: Start`

## Template Languages (so far) 🧙‍♂️

- `HTML`
- `TypeScript`

## Limitations 🤷‍♂️

These are WIP.

- No way to read comments at this time.
- Limited to 30 stories at this time.
- Not a lot of settings, or methods of using this extension other than command palette at this time.

TODO: Add usage screenshots
